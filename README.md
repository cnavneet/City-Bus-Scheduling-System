# "City bus scheduling system:A Data structures and algorithms project that takes  between different bus-stops in an adjacency matrix and allocates buses using Dijkstra's Algorithm, Allocates buses on different routes throughout the city with respect to the availability constraints of the buses in a bus depot and in order to cover the maximum area."
